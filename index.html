    <h1>Metallica - One</h1>
        
    <p>I can't remember anything
        Can't tell if this is true or dream
        Deep down inside I feel to scream
        This terrible silence stops me</p>
        
    <p>Now that the war is through with me
         I'm waking up, I cannot see
         That there is not much left of me
         Nothing is real but pain now    
         Hold my breath as I wish for death
         Oh please, God, wake me</p>
        
    <p>Back in the womb it's much
        too real
        In pumps life that I must feel
        But can't look forward to reveal
        Look to the time when I'll live</p>
        
    <p>Back in the womb it's much

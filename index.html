    <h1>I can't remember anything
        Can't tell if this is true or dream
        Deep down inside I feel to scream
        This terrible silence stops me</h1>
        
        <p>Now that the war is through with me
            I'm waking up, I cannot see
            That there is not much left of me
            Nothing is real but pain now
            
            Hold my breath as I wish for death
            Oh please, God, wake me</p>
